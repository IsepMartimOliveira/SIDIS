#Story Telling


At first, we started by studying the problem that was assigned to us by reading the Assignment
PDF which help us get the general idea about what the project is all about.

It was suggested from the teaching staff that we should start by doing a brief analysis on each use case, using the 
knowledge we had acquired from previous subjects related to software engineering, set up a domain model with the classes we
think our project needs and also doing diagrams such as sequence diagrams and class diagrams. Each of us has done this individually, 
but we asked questions and shared ideas with each other because it is a group project were all of us should be in the same route.


After that, we had a talk with the laboratory teacher which told us that our domain model was good in his perspective. Then we decided we were going to 
deliver all use cases of the Phase 1 to the client in the first project submission.


After the submission of this iteration, we aim to continue improving Phase 1 and start develop Phase 2 in order to get a good feedback form the client.

In general, Phase 2 was easier than Phase 1 because we just needed to add new endpoints and implement them in the best way possible. All the necessary files were already 
created. in addition, we did a few tests in order to make this project as complete as possible.
