## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As Marketing director, I want to define a new Plan detailing the monthly and annual cost, the maximum number of devices and other characteristics of the plan


### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the specifications document:**

The company offers several plans and needs the ability to create new plans to adapt to market.
Due to marketing reasons, the company wants to be able to promote a plan, 
that is, give an highlight to a certain plan, for example, 
by rendering it on the web page with a different layout that gives it 
more screen area than the others. In the previous example, 
the Gold plan is the promoted plan. Plans can also be deactivated or ceased.
A deactivated plan is one that no longer is available for subscription but
remains inforce for current active subscribers of such plan. 
A plan can only be ceased if there are no current subscribers of such plan.

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

* Plans
* Active
* AnnualFee
* Description
* MaximumNumberOfUsers
* MonthlyFee
* MusicCollection
* MusicSuggestion
* Name
* NumberOfMinutes
* Plans
* Promoted

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
* PlansController
* PlansRepository
* PlansService
* CreatePlansMapper
* PlansServiceImpl
* CreatePlanRequest
* PlansViewMapper
* PlansView
* PlansRepositoryImpl

# 5. Observations
* To follow the principle of Information expert the Class Plans was divided in others 10 Classes. 
* It´s created two instances of the Plan. The first one runs on localhost:8081 and the second at the localhost:8090.
* There is one  Database(DB) associated with which instances of Plan created.
* It makes an HTTP API call to the other instance to confirm the Plan doesn´t already exists. This guarantees that uniqueness in the all the DBs
